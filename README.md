rasd is a RADIUS client simulator for testing a AAA or RADIUS server.
It can create thousands of sessions which would then simulate actual active
users by generating RADIUS requests.

You can have control over simulation by creating a RAS type. Currently, RAS type
for Mikrotik devices is useable.

For more information take a look at the rasd.conf .
